# Note-Taker

This app allows the user to create and save notes in a very simple and easy to use format. Node.js and Express were used to create a local server in order to save the information. This was a very challenging project and was my first foray into anything that relates to a backend portion of a website. I will continue to improve upon the functions of this app as I learn more.
